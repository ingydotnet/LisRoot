Dear editors,

I contact you to inquire about a possible publication in Computing in Science and Engineering. I have developed a functional scripting interface to an object oriented C++ library. I have chosen a best practice example – CERN’s ROOT library, designed to handle the enormous amounts of data generated by the world’s largest particle accelerator – and translated a simple segment of its tutorial into Clojure, a functional language from the Lisp family. The code examples demonstrate how functional programming straightforwardly expresses scientific ideas. Subsequently, I developed a Lisp-C++ interoperation to access the ROOT library via functional code. To preserve the expressivity of the Lisp code, the type hints necessary for C++ code generation are stored in a separate file. The interop system presented here is a generic tool intended to access arbitrary C++ libraries.

Allow me to share a little background: I am a former physicist who turned into a freelance programmer after a stint in finance. Together with a Physics Professor who is looking for efficient and intuitive ways to analyze his data, I drafted a manuscript on the project. We want to publish the manuscript and we think that the Software Engineering track of the CiSE magazine would be an ideal venue. However, neither of us has experience in publishing in computer science, therefore we kindly ask you to assess the manuscript for its suitability for your magazine or advise on other suitable IEEE Computer Science publications. Please find attached a preprint which also includes a link to all relevant code.

Sincerely

Markus Kloimwieder
